                            <h1>pastelhex is a programmer and designer for the web and games. Their main career interest is web design and front-end development.</h1>
                            <p>pastelhex is currently attending university full-time where they are studying information technology.</p>
                            <p>Some of the technologies they have used in projects are Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, <a href="https://github.com/pastelhex97/jobographic" target="_blank" title="Jobographic Web Application">APIs</a>, and <a href="http://njcommunitymentalhealth.org"
                                    target="_blank" title="Non-Profit CBMHS Website">Wordpress</a>, although they also love making graphics and illustrations. Currently they are interested in Wordpress (and maybe Tumblr) theme development and are working on making a <a href="{{ site.url }}/2018-blog" target="_blank" title="blog">blog</a> and maintaining a social media presence.</p>
                            <p>When not coding, they are either watching dramas or anime, writing, or posting their artwork online. As a completionist, they love checking off every little thing that has to be done. They have a family of parrotlets which they love dearly, and unsurprisingly consider birds and lizards some of their favorite animals.</p>
                            <p>They are currently looking for an internship in the Central Jersey area in web development, design, video games, or another IT position.</p>
